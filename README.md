An easy and fun to play with javascript framework, just like a kitten! Some of the features are:

- **Javascript-in-html**. Your entire ui is managed using low level Javascript functions embedded directly into your html.
- **Small and fast**. Kitten is designed to be like a real kitten, really tiny, and really quick. Kitten is only **2.79KiB**!
- **Easy to use**. This framework can be adopted with a single script tag, and is very good for adding small interactive bits to a website.

## Installation

Kitten.js can be installed with just a single script tag. Simply add [insert script tag here later when you have one] to your html file, and you can start! You can also install the `kitten.js` npm package and use a bundler.

## Documentation

There is currently no documentation for kitten.js, but there will be in the future!

## Examples

There are several larger use case examples on the [kitten.js website](#), but here is a quick example:

<!-- todo: add kitten.js website link -->

```html
<div
  id="app"
  k-data="{
    name: 'world'
}"
>
  <p>Hello, <span k-text="this.name.toUpperCase()"></span>!</p>
</div>
```
